# Pokemon-Guessing-Game-Node
A command-line version of the Pokemon guessing game. 

## How to Play
Just type one letter at a time to guess this hang-man style game. If you get it right, the letter will be filled in next time the word is displayed. After winning, you'll be prompted to play another game. Please type Y or N. 

## Project History
This project was an optional homework assignment for the Columbia Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, testing our ability to use JavaScript constructors. Because our first JavaScript assignment was also a guessing game, I chose to continue with the same theme from that first assignment and have the player guess Pokemon names. This time, I'm gathering the Pokemon names from <pokeapi.co>.
